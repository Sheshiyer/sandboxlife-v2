# Dashboard V2: The Adventurer's Guide 🛡️

Welcome to **Dashboard V2**, the immersive "Game Mode" for SandboxLife. This interface transforms your journaling experience from a standard productivity tool into a fantasy role-playing adventure.

This guide serves as your **Player's Handbook**, walking you through the features, mechanics, and journey of using the Adventurer's Dashboard.

## 🗺️ What is Dashboard V2?

Dashboard V2 is a complete visual and functional overhaul designed to make self-reflection feel like an epic quest. Instead of lists and calendars, you interact with:
- **3D Floating Cards**: Your entries represented as magical artifacts.
- **The Quadrants**: A holistic view of your well-being (Mind, Body, Spirit, Heart).
- **The Map**: A timeline of your journey visualized as a path through a fantasy realm.
- **The Tavern**: A social hub for connecting with other adventurers.
